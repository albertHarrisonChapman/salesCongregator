# salesCongregator

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This program takes an input file of a list of strings and congretates them into a file with the strings and how many times they appeared in the file.

What did you do particularly well?
The program is best as a modular construction, and can easily be modified and improved.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
The code could be enhanced by better output formatting, and could be made more modular by making the menu an object or object function.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging part to code was the container iterator, It required me to look up iterators for diffrent containers and modify them for the map container.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The ability to write modular code is the most transferable, as any code repository will need code that can be changed and augmented quickly and easily.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
In order to make the code readable and maintanable, I used many in line comments to describe its processes.
