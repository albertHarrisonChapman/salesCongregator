# salesCongregator

This program takes an input file of a list of strings and congretates them into a file with the strings and how many times they appeared in the file.

The program is best as a modular construction, and can easily be modified and improved.

The code could be enhanced by better output formatting, and could be made more modular by making the menu an object or object function.

The most challenging part to code was the container iterator, It required me to look up iterators for diffrent containers and modify them for the map container

The ability to write modular code is the most transferable, as any code repository will need code that can be changed and augmented quickly and easily.

In order to make the code readable and maintanable, I used many in line comments to describe its processes.
